If are currently working on "pulling" and "pushing" using git, refer to the steps below:  
    1) If you haven't made a github account yet, refer to [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account), ALso, install 
    [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Do **NOT** install from source. Instead, install the version particular to your OS  
    2) Once you've made an account, make sure you link your account to [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github). Follow steps until editor integration.  
    3) Create your own branch on the repo. To do this, enter in this command in the **terminal** of VSCODE: git checkout -b "YOUR_NAME"  
    4) You are now using your own branch! If you want to confirm this, check the branches on our repo on github  
    5) Now, change the print statement to include your name.  
    6) After you're done, "push" your changes! Hint: You want to add the file that's been modified. Then you want to commit your changes and add a message. Then, you want to "push" your changes  
    7) Pay attention! The next few instructions will be presented on screen
